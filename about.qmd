Hi, I'm Lily.

I'm a data scientist who loves turning abstract problems into clear, actionable solutions.

I help scientists, researchers, and leaders tackle their toughest challenges by guiding them through the entire data science pipelineâ€”from gathering and cleaning data to applying machine learning, AI, and statistical analysis.

My goal is to empower users to make informed, data-driven decisions and gain deeper insights through compelling visualizations and build interactive tools.
