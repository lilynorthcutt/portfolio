        "This project aims to deepen our understanding of magmatic migration within the Sierra Nevadas. The current samples of geologic ages do not provide uniform coverage of the area. This project aims to offer a solution to this problem by exploring the success of various machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict geologic ages within the region.\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Magmatism plays a key role in mountain formation, as ascending magmas add mass and volume to the Earth's surface and subsurface. However, the causes and rates of magma movement remain largely unknown, necessitating a deeper understanding of these processes. The mountains and canyons in the Sierra Nevadas are formed from granitic rocks, which originated from molten rock that cooled far beneath the Earth's surface. By examining the geologic ages within this area, we can gain insights into the age of the rocks at various locations and understand the magmatic migration and processes that created them.\n",
        "\n",
        "The current data in the Sierra Nevadas does not uniformly cover the area, making it unrepresentative of the entire region. This is a common problem in geology, as uniformly collecting samples across a region is often impractical due to constraints such as time, resources, coverage area, or sample accessibility. Therefore, there is a need for novel methods to mitigate sampling bias and use geologic age samples to predict uniform coverage of the area.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Project Goals:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The key goals this project aims to address are the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Develop novel machine learning (ML)** methods to fill gaps in geologic maps by predicting undated rock ages.\n",
        "-   **Apply the results from the model to predict** undated rock ages, providing a less biased view of magmatic migration.\n",
        "-   **Build Interactive Visualizations** for researchers and curious minds to view and explore the data and predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project was done with `python` for all data cleaning, model training/evaluation, and predictions, and `R` for interactive visualizations in Shiny. he full code is extensive, so some parts are omitted here for brevity. Please refer to the link at the top to view the notebook with the entire code.\n",

        "Let's begin!\n",
        "\n",
        "## Preprocessing\n",

        "#### Second Round of Feature Engineering\n",
        "\n",
        "Within the cross-validation sets, I perform a second round of feature engineering to prevent data leakage and preserve the integrity of the model's predictions. It's crucial to avoid allowing the models to see the testing data, even within cross-validation folds.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why not let `GridSearchCV()` split the data into k-folds?**\n",
        "\n",
        "While it might seem convenient to let `GridSearchCV` handle data splitting later on, there's an important reason for my approach. We already have some good features, but it's vital to provide the data with additional context about its surroundings. Specifically, for a given point `o_0`, I calculate the age, distance, and angle of the next closest points: `o_1`, `o_2`, and `o_3.` This is done in two dimensions (combining Easting and Northing) and individually for Easting, Northing, and Elevation in one dimension.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Preventing Leakage and Overfitting**\n",
        "\n",
        "A major concern in this process is data leakage, which occurs when the training data gets insights from the testing data, potentially leading to overfitting. To prevent this, we add these features only after all splitting has been completed:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Training Data: The training data will have age/distance/bearing labels based on the training data itself.\n",
        "-   Test Data: Both the hold-out and cross-validation test sets will have age/distance/bearing labels based on the training data only.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Using `GridSearchCV()` for Hyper-Parameter Tuning** For hyper-parameter tuning of most models, I use `GridSearchCV()`. To integrate the custom feature engineering steps, I define a custom cross-validation (CV) class that uses the predefined CV indices along with the training set. This class adds the new features to the training and testing folds separately before training the models.\n",

By leveraging advanced algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gaussian Process Regressors, we have provided valuable insights into magmatic migration and rock formation processes. The Gaussian Process Regressor emerged as the top performer, offering a robust model with an R2 score of 0.81.\n",

        "This approach allows us to present a less biased view of magmatic migration, enhancing our understanding of the geological history in the Sierra Nevadas.\n",

These visualizations offer an intuitive and engaging way to examine geologic ages, model predictions, and spatial relationships, making the data more accessible and informative.\n",

        "**Broadening Application Results:**\n",

        "-   Finding other use case areas to apply the methodology explored here, and compare results to see if the modeling can be applied universally or only at this location\n",

        "-   Add Models:Add grid of boundary area predicted by models to show ages predicted uniformly over the area\n",
        "-   Age Histogram: Add histogram of ages corresponding to the ages in the map (i.e. lines up with the Age sliderbar)\n",
